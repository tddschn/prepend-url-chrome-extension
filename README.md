## Usage

2. In the 'Replace' tab, enter the regex pattern in the 'Find' field and the replacement string in the 'Replace' field.
3. Click on the "Replace in URL" button to update the current tab's URL based on your regex pattern.

### Using Presets
1. Go to the 'Presets' tab in the popup.
2. Click on any of the saved find and replace pairs to apply them to the current tab's URL.

### Managing Presets
- **Access Options Page:** Right-click on the extension icon and select 'Options'.
- **Add New Pair:** Use the form at the top of the options page.
- **Edit, Delete, or Reorder Pairs:** Select one or more pairs and choose the appropriate action.
- **Export Presets:** Click the "Export Presets" button to download the presets as a JSON file. The filename will include the extension name and a timestamp.
- **Import Presets:** Use the file input to upload a JSON file containing presets.
